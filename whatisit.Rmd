### What is CompARE?

<hr>

**CompARE** is a web-platform inspired to provide help on issues
relating to trials with composite endpoints. **CompARE** may be used as
a tool for calculating the elements needed in the planning phase of
clinical trials involving composite endpoints. With its user-friendly
interface, CompARE allows to input the main parameters included in the
trial -such as the treatment effect on the components of the composite
endpoint, and its frequencies of occurrence- and helps provide power and
sample size calculations among others.

<br>

### Apps

<hr>

**CompARE** is split into two apps for time-to-event and binary
endpoints, respectively. They are implemented with the Shiny R package.
<br> Time to event app (button) and binary app (button)

### Features

<hr>

-   Effect size: Studying the treatment effect for the composite
    endpoint

-   Sample Size: Computing the number of patients under different
    scenarios

-   Endpoint Selection: Identifying the best endpoint combination for
    the design

-   Association:Assessing the degree of association between components
