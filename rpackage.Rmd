[**CompARE**](https://cinna.upc.edu/compare/)
(<https://cinna.upc.edu/compare/>) is a web-platform inspired to provide
help on issues relating to trials with composite endpoints. CompARE may
be used as a tool for calculating the elements needed in the planning
phase of clinical trials involving composite endpoints. With its
user-friendly interface, CompARE allows to input the main parameters
included in the trial -such as the treatment effect on the components of
the composite endpoint, and its frequencies of occurrence- and helps
provide power and sample size calculations among others.

[**CompARE**](https://cinna.upc.edu/compare/) comprises two different
Shiny apps: one devoted to time-to-event endpoints, the other to binary
endpoints.

-   **CompARE for Time-to-event endpoints**: [Time-to-event
    app](http://cinna.upc.edu:3838/compare/CompARETimeToEvent/).
-   **CompARE for Binary endpoints**: [Binary
    app](http://cinna.upc.edu:3838/compare/CompAREBinary/).

You can also find the R-package version of CompARE in CRAN
[CompAREdesign](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CompAREdesign/index.html).

## Getting Started

If you are a newcomer, we recommend starting with the tutorial
vignettes. These vignettes provide an introduction to CompARE:

-   **Time-to-event Tutorial**: Guide document of CompARE for
    Time-to-event endpoints [Time-to-event
    Tutorial](http://cinna.upc.edu:3838/compare/CompARETimeToEvent/help_Tutorial.html).
-   **Binary Tutorial**: Guide document of CompARE for Binary endpoints
    [Binary
    Tutorial](http://cinna.upc.edu:3838/compare/CompAREBinary/Help-Tutorial.html).

## `CompAREdesign` R package

The `CompAREdesign` package contains the following functions:

-   *prob_cbe* to compute the probability of a composite binary
    endpoint;\
-   *lower_corr* to compute the lower bound of Pearson's correlation;
-   *upper_corr* to compute the upper bound for Pearson's correlation;
-   *effectsize_cbe* to compute the treatment effect on the composite
    binary endpoint;
-   *samplesize_cbe* to compute the sample size for composite binary
    endpoint;
-   *ARE_cbe* to compute the ARE method for composite binary endpoint;
-   *surv_tte* to compute the survival function for the composite
    endpoint and both components;
-   *effectsize_tte* to compute the treatment effect for the composite
    endpoint;
-   *samplesize_tte* to compute the sample size for the composite
    endpoint;
-   *ARE_tte* to compute the ARE method for time-to-event endpoints;
-   *plot_tte* Returns four plots related to previous features;
-   *simula_tte* to simulate time-to-event data for the composite and
    its components.

``` r
require(devtools)
install_github("CompARE-Composite/CompARE-package") #developers version
