<!-- Dr. **Emily Johnson** is a renowned statistician and expert in adaptive designs for clinical trials. She received her Ph.D. in Biostatistics from XYZ University and has over 15 years of experience in the field. Dr. Johnson has published numerous articles on adaptive trial designs and has been invited to speak at various international conferences. Her research focuses on developing innovative statistical methods for improving the efficiency and ethical aspects of clinical trials. -->

**Title of Talk:** Deconstructing the Max-combo Test



The Max-Combo Test (Lin et al., 2020) is an adaptive procedure to select the best test statistic from a small prespecified set of candidates. It includes a correction for multiplicity. Proposed applications include clinical trials in oncology when there is prior uncertainty regarding the commonly made proportional hazards assumption. In this context, the candidate set of test statistics usually come from the Fleming-Harrington rho-gamma family of weighted log-rank statistics. In some of the candidate test statistics, the weighting is tilted towards events occurring in the early part of follow up, whereas in others it is tilted towards events in the later part of follow up. The overall procedure is therefore robust to a wide range of treatment effect patterns. 

In this talk I shall take a close look at the Max-Combo Test, using recently proposed visualization techniques (Jimenez et al., 2023) to explain some of its counter-intuitive properties, as pointed out in recent publications (Freidlin & Korn, 2019). The same visualization techniques can be used to re-evaluate weighted log-rank tests in the broader context of the estimand framework in clinical trials.
