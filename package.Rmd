## `CompAREdesign` R package

The `CompAREdesign` package contains the following functions:

-   *prob_cbe* to compute the probability of a composite binary
    endpoint;\
-   *lower_corr* to compute the lower bound of Pearson's correlation;
-   *upper_corr* to compute the upper bound for Pearson's correlation;
-   *effectsize_cbe* to compute the treatment effect on the composite
    binary endpoint;
-   *samplesize_cbe* to compute the sample size for composite binary
    endpoint;
-   *ARE_cbe* to compute the ARE method for composite binary endpoint;
-   *surv_tte* to compute the survival function for the composite
    endpoint and both components;
-   *effectsize_tte* to compute the treatment effect for the composite
    endpoint;
-   *samplesize_tte* to compute the sample size for the composite
    endpoint;
-   *ARE_tte* to compute the ARE method for time-to-event endpoints;
-   *plot_tte* Returns four plots related to previous features;
-   *simula_tte* to simulate time-to-event data for the composite and
    its components.
